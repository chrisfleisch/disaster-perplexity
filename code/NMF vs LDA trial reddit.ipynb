And, of course, their cocktails are excellent. I feel like their food is slightly overpriced when it's not happy hour (love it during HH though). That said, the vibe, service, atmosphere, etc at Herbs and Rye makes it worthwhile, IMO.\\n\\nThe Ellis Island deal is a great deal, but is just an okay steak. If it was $- very few people would be into it, but it's a solid meal at a great price. Also, their beers are surprising good! Brewed on site. They have a few different brews and while they're not mind-blowing, they're all solid craft beers. It's a bummer that they don't include the beer in the deal anymore, but last time I was there aoz was, I think, $, so it's not a huge problem. You should check it out for the kitch factor (and to sing some karaoke) but it's not really comparable to Herbs and Rye in quality or atmosphere.\\n\\nEdit: contractions are hard..\",\n",
